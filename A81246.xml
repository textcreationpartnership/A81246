            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Of God,</hi> they know not God, his Infinitenesse, his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity, his Soveraignty, his inconcevable perfections. It is not the work of a few days to know God. We may truly say

                  <hi>Life is short, but the work is great.</hi> Indeed it is not the work of time, but of eternity.

                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:120712:12"/> 2. They are ignorant of their own hearts; they know not themselves: their want of knowledge, their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in grace, the discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure of their own spirits, their estrangement from God; and the like. A true and deepe sense of these would awaken them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy and diligence in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on the Ordinances.

               <p>Fifthly, that may lead to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:120712:17"/>another sad consideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You little know how soon Gospel-seasons may be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Among our selves is found the highest contempt of the Gospel, and the Gospel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, that ever was among a people:

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:120712:17"/>yet God deals with us in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals, as once for <hi>Egypt</hi> in temporals; he gives us <hi>yeares of plenty,</hi> before he bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us the black yeares of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.

               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, to be sure, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>6</label>
                  <hi>loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a fore-runner of losing the Gospel;</hi> when the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites began to loath the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, which fell every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round about their <hi>tents;</hi> it continued not long. And
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:120712:18"/>it is observed that a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the French Massacre, Protestants were cloy'd with the Word. Formerly people would have run far and near to have enjoyed such oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities; if now you be afraid of it, or despise it, it will be a sad presage that judgement is not far off.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, let the zeal and forwardnesse of other places provoke you. Oh, how have I seen the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations within the City thronged? how is this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Exercise sued for and begg'd for, by Ministers and their well-affected people, with greatest importunity, as great Charters are wont to be begg'd and sued for to Princes by their subjects! And I blesse God to see it: Oh
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:120712:18"/>let not this remain as a blot upon <hi>Giles</hi> in the fields, that this Ark was brought home to your doores, and you said, as it were, it should not come into your habitation; that this Morning-Exercise was brought into this place, and the pewes were empty; the inhabitants of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish did not regard it.</p>
               <p>The Apostle useth the same argument in another case upon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8.</p>
               <p>Oh let not the zeal and affection of other people rise up in judgement against this end of the town and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive. </seg>8</label> you will do as much for your bodies, and outward man, and more too. Were rare <hi>sights</hi> to be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:120712:19"/>seen here every morning, for a moneth or two together, or were some <hi>rich doles</hi> to be distributed, there would be such throngs of people, that the walls and windows would not contain them. Christians, here are the <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God</hi> to be seen; here are the <hi>unsearchable riches</hi> of Christ to be dispensed. Oh evidence to your selves and others, that you believe you have immortal soules, more worth then ten thousand worlds.</p>
               <p>Ninethly, the body veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may be a gainer as well as your soules; these morning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visits may be <hi>physick</hi> to your <hi>bodies,</hi> as well as <hi>food</hi> to your <hi>soules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tenthly, however let me admonish you of this, that a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:120712:19"/>single voluntary omission may prove greatly prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to your spiritual good. Observe that passage in the Gospel-story:
<note place="margin">John 23.24. Luke 25.</note>
                  <hi>But Thomas one of the twelve was not with them when Jesus came,</hi> what the cause of his absence was, we reade not; sure I am this single absence was like to have cost him dear, even his faith: they tell him, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>We have seen the Lord:</hi> but hear what a peremptory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply he makes, <hi>Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nailes,
<note place="margin">Verse 25.</note> and put my finger into the print of his nailes, and thrust my hands into his side. I will not beleeve.</hi> Had Christ taken him at his word, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> might have for ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed his absence from the meeting of the disciples in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:120712:20"/>eternal flames.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, in the next place let me tell you thus much. God hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make use of this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Exercise, for great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and good to many soules, since the first erecting of it. In times of feares, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have come trembling and dismayed with evil ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, have dismist with comfort and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; their hands have been strengthened, and their hearts have been encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Lord. Many that have been dubious and stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering about their way, have been setled and resolved: some have drawn their first spiritual breath in this aire, others have been preserved and secured, in the sad Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasy
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:120712:20"/>from Anabaptisme, Antinomianisme, Antiscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturisme, Atheisme, Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of these times, and that which hath been the cause and source of them all, <hi>boundlesse liberty</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Congregation to <hi>hold,</hi> and <hi>hold forth</hi> what they will, <hi>without giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt to any.</hi> I say, God hath made use of it for the stay of Apostasy, and the cementery of many Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in the truth and unity of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Who knows what work God hath for this Morning-Exercise in this place? Only withdraw not your selves out of Christs rode, as I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you in the coherence of the words, <hi>vers.</hi> 18. God honours the Word with his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:120712:21"/>blessing, do you honout it with your attendance.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly and lastly, say not, We may have future op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, what need of such present importunity?</p>
               <p>Nay, my brethren, but death may quickly cut off hat reckoning; your life may yet end, before the end of the Morning-Exercise. Oh lay in for eternity: <hi>In this your day know the things of your peace, before they be hid from your eyes:</hi> while ye have the light come to the light, our dayes are swift, as swift as an Eagle; <hi>Oh be you swift to hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I should now come to give you some Rules or Cautions about this service. But of this in the next.</p>

                     <hi>come con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly;</hi> you know who said, <hi>It is good to be zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously affected alwayes in a good thing.</hi> It is good, and there is a <hi>blessing</hi> in it; <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is the man that heareth me,</hi> (saith the Wisdome of God) <hi>watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doores.</hi> Brethren, is not <hi>your heavenly Fathers blessing</hi> worth the coming for every morning?

Tush, I would not go over the threshold to hear such
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:120712:24"/>a man; Brethren, this ought not so to be, we should come for the Ordinance-sake, and not for the mans sake. In this sense,
<note place="margin">Jam, 2.1.</note>
                     <hi>we should not have the faith of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is to be feared, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of these times is a fore-runner of famine; and they that for wantonnesse do now cry, <hi>Whom shall we hear to day?</hi> may ere long cry to for want, <hi>Oh where shall we heare, whither shall we go to bear a faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Brethren, let me freely, speak unto you. I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, that the most of those dislikes, which you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain against some Ministers of the Gospel; your heads,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:120712:25"/>hearts and consciences, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing to their fidelity,) are but the groundlesse prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and sinful distempers of your own hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sampson,</hi> when he had got his great victory, threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his jaw-bone, but when slain almost with thirst, God sends him to his jaw-bone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; ye are not now full, and <hi>Provender, as we say, pricks you;</hi> if a spiritual drought come, you would be glad of the worst of your despised Ministers. In the mean time, let me tell you, He is a sorry Minister indeed, (if I say faithful,) by whom you may not get something worth your paines in hearing, were your heart in a mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gracious frame.</p>
                  <p>I have heard some emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:120712:25"/>Christians acknowledge, that after some disputes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they should hear such and such a man, because of some private jealousies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their spirits, yet determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by this consideration: <hi>I go for the Ordinance sake, not for the mans sake;</hi> God hath made it the most seasonable Word, that ever they heard.</p>
                  <p>The stories themselves would be too long. And therefore, Christians, look to your own hearts; and if the Minister want quicknesse in preaching, do thou make it up in the lively actings of thine own grace, lest other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it appears, it is <hi>parts</hi> that act thee, and not <hi>spirituality</hi> and <hi>soundnesse</hi> of matter.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>5</label>
                     <hi>Observe God (therefore) in the variety
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:120712:26"/>of the gifts and graces of his Ministers:</hi> and learn to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the <hi>manifold Wisdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Corinth</hi> hath bequeathed her wantonnesse to <hi>London,</hi> we <hi>are puffed up for one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4 6.</note> for one <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the Gospel</hi> against an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; we cannot commend one, but we must despise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. But we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the Spirit is the fountain of all their gifts and graces, how different soever; it is the excellencies of these starres, that though one star differ from another in glory, yet God made them all; and <hi>he calls them all by their names.</hi> The H. Ghost is called the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Spirits of God,</hi> Rev. 1.4. for his manifold and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry operations, so that you
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:120712:26"/>cannot easily despise the gifts of any <hi>that ars sincere,</hi> but by interpretation you judge the Spirit, and despise the Spirit: as it is said of the poore, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.5.</p>
                  <p>This you may observe, (and it would help you) that the meanest of the faithful Ministers of the Gospel hath some excellency above his brethren; as in the natural body, every member hath an usefulnesse, an honour proper to it self,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.25.</note> that so there might be no schisme in the body: and many times God is pleased to use the meaner gift for the greater service, because he delights to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour sincerity above <hi>parts.</hi> Come then Christians,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.10.</note> to the word, with your expectations upon God, and not upon the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:120712:27"/>Preacher. <hi>You may easily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-expect the creature, you can never over-expect God.</hi>

                  <p>Take heed, when ye have <hi>begun in the Spirit,</hi> that you <hi>do not end in the flesh.</hi> Keep this upon your hearts as an antidote against temptation. <hi>I have been with God this morning,</hi> and how shall I do this great wickednesse, and profane my approaches to God? <hi>I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are prone to conceive themselves discharged, when they have been in duty; not

            <p>Many Observations might be raised from the words;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:120712:32"/>But I shall put them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one Observation, and 'tis this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>That God takes it very ill, and it is a high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to his Majesty, when he vouchsafes the choicest and most precious meanes for a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Reformation and salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet under all those meanes they remain obstinate and irreformed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis that you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained frequently all along the Prophets in the very words of the Text.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:120712:33"/>the cost, care and paines he had been at in his vineyard, his expectations were disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.

            <p>In such earriage of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple towards God, thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having himself towards them, there is</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Thetenders &amp; offers of grace and reconciliation neglected.</hi>

            <p>Christians, this day is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares on Gods part; For,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:120712:34"/>First, <hi>God hath sent;</hi> and whom hath he sent? he hath not sent <hi>gifted brethren</hi> among you, he hath not sent loose and debauched men of wretched principles, to speak to you the vision of their hearts; of whom God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.21. <hi>I have not sent these Prophets, yet they ran, I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied;</hi> But God hath sent to you his <hi>servants the Prophets;</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets <hi>by calling,</hi> men set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for the work of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel by <hi>ministerial ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> he hath sent to you Ministers that have appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themselves to be the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, that have ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the designes and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests of Christ faithfully in their places. And thirdly,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:120712:35"/>God hath sent all his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>i.e. in great number,</hi> (if we take in the next day,
<note n="*" place="margin">The Fast at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of the mnethly-Exercile.</note> which we hope to enjoy) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty Ministers God hath sent among you this moneth. Fourthly, Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>their diligence, rising up early,</hi> you have been invited out of your beds into Gods presence; the first breath you have breathed in the morning, hath been in Gods Sanctnary. Fifthly, they have used <hi>great importunity, Sending,</hi> he hath sent them, they have doubled their pains, trod upon the heeles one of another, every man hath drawn out his bowels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, spent their spirits, they have preached as if they should never preach again. And Sixthly, what hath their
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:120712:35"/>
               <hi>message</hi> been? it hath been to <hi>Reformation,</hi> that you would now <hi>turn to God;</hi> their Texts and Sermons have been nothing else but <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, Motives</hi> and <hi>Meanes</hi> to Reformation, for the rolling away, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hinderances and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions out of your way. To this end, let me helpe your memories by way of a summary rehearsal of their morning-labours among you, which is the chiefest desigue of this concluding Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.</p>
            <p>The first was but a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory to all the rest,
<note place="margin">The first morning.</note> it was but like the voice of <hi>John Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptist in the wildernesse, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the way of the Lord,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some brief <hi>directions</hi> how
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:120712:36"/>you should <hi>hear,</hi> and how you should artend upon the Morning-Exercise, that it might be of use and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to your soules.</p>
            <p>The second he comes,
<note place="margin">The second morning.</note> and from <hi>Isa.</hi> 22.12. <hi>In that day did the Lord God of hostes call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldnesse, and to girding with sackcloth.</hi> He gave you this observation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. That the time of Gods incensed anger should be the time of the sinners hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such is his abundant mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that he calls men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance before he break in upon them by his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He shoots off his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:120712:36"/>
               <hi>warning pieces,</hi> before he gives fire to his <hi>murdering pieces. In that day the Lord did call;</hi> how doth he call? he calls outwardly, inwardly.</p>
            <p>Outwardly, he calls by his <hi>Word;</hi> every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is a call, every cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter is a call, every verse is a call. He calls by his <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> all your mercies are so many calls to obedience. He cals by his <hi>judgments,</hi> even the <hi>Rod</hi> hath a voice; and where the <hi>rod</hi> hath a voice, we should have an eare. <hi>Hear the rod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He calls <hi>inwardly,</hi> by the <hi>stirrings and impulses of his own Spirit,</hi> and therefore the duty was urged upon you by these heart melting <hi>Arguments.</hi> 1. Warning ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected will make vengeance
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:120712:37"/>most furious. 2. Slighting of judgement, is the greatest judgement that can befall a people. 3. It argues horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pride. 4 Desperate se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. And, 5. 'Tis attended upon with such anger and wrath, as the tongue of an Angel is not able to speak, nor the heart of man able to conceive; <hi>Because I have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and you would not hearken, you shall call, and I will not haerken, &amp;c.</hi> Prov. 1.24.</p>
            <p>The third comes,
<note place="margin">The third morning.</note> and sets sorth to you (as it were) the <hi>nature</hi> and the <hi>condition</hi> of such a people, as <hi>neglect Gods Call,</hi> from <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.4. <hi>I said, Surely these are poor, they are foolish; for they know not the way of the Lord, nor the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their God.</hi> And
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:120712:37"/>from thence he gives you this sad <hi>Observation, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>That rebels are a poor and beggarly genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let them be never so great and honourable, they are poor <hi>civilly,</hi> and poor <hi>spiritually;</hi> they are poor <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They are poor <hi>antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> for the most part the lowest of people are the worst of people. It was the rabble rout that was gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together against <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Poor <hi>concomitantly;</hi> usually they think their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty will bear them out in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wickednesse.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are poor <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently.</hi> Poverty is their judgement. Many time; God

            <p>And then they are poor <hi>spiritually,</hi> poor in their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals;</hi> ignorance is the poverty of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: wicked men are not worth one dram of saving knowledge; they are poor in <hi>grace,</hi> they think <hi>themselves rich, that they abound in goods, and want nothing,</hi> and know not that they are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blinde, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:120712:39"/>of neglecting Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; and from <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. <hi>Those times of ignorance God winked at, but now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth all men every where to repent;</hi> gave these three excellent Observations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. <hi>Times of Paganism were times of ignorance.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Times of the Gospel are times wherein God bespeaks e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, every where to repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 1. Use was, to reprove those Preachers, who in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-times cry down repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and sorrow of heart: there is abundance of such preaching and Preachers, the Lord deliver us from them.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:120712:40"/>
            <p> Secondly, such people as are not engaged by Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensations to Gospel-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>But much more they in the third place, that encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage themselves to live in sin, because they live in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-times; this is sad.</p>
            <p>The second <hi>Æ²se,</hi> the Use of Exhortation from three Motives: <hi>scilicet,</hi> 1. The expectation of God. 2. The uncertainty of the Spirits motions: And 3.

            <p>The sixth,
<note place="margin">The sixth morning.</note> he holds out Christ unto you, as sealed to the Office of a Mediatour by God the Father, from <hi>John</hi> 6.27. <hi>Him hath God the

            </p>
            <p>The first Use was, to make them tremble that neglect and refuse Christ; for they neglect a sealed Saviour, they neglect him whom the Father hath sealed.</p>
            <p>The second Use was, to shew the necessity of getting Christ; since neither Saints nor Angels were sealed, but only the Lord Jesus; O close with Christ, take him upon Gods termes, <hi>Him, him hath God the Father sealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Use spake infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite comfort to them that do close with Christ, <hi>'tis a sealed
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:120712:41"/>Redeemer,</hi> that you have taken and made choice of, and such as have taken Christ whom the Father hath sealed, may urge the <hi>Father</hi> with his <hi>Seal,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> with his <hi>Office:</hi> Lord, thou hast sealed Christ: Blessed Jesus, thou art seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Office of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour; O sweet Lord, do thy Office, subdue my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, sanctifie my heart, and so forth.

            <p>Doctr. <hi>That sins are the soules bonds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Bonds tie things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so do sins; one sin doth link in with another; sin doth tie the sinner and the curse together, binding over the guilty creature to hell, and the wrath of God for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Bonds gall the body, so sins gall the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

            <p>Therefore upon these considerations he perswades you, 1. To hate sin. 2. To destroy sin. 3. To get out of those bonds of sin, as you tender your own soules. The course and means was, 1. To get into Christ; If the Son make you free, you shall be free indeed. 2. To give up your selves to his service.</p>

            <p>It was an excellent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and deserved the Presse as well as the Pulpit, the Lord impresse it upon your hearts.</p>
            <p>The tenth he comes, and from <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26. <hi>What shall it profit a man to gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</hi> he pointed to you the preciousnesse of your immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:120712:44"/>heaven-born soules, and gave you this doctrine.</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>That the gaine of the world cannot countervaile the losse of a soule.</hi> Witnesse, 1. God that made it. 2. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the impresse of the soule, 'tis stamp't with the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God. 3. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of it, it is immortal, it cannot die. 4. Witnesse the price paid for it, O the soule cost the precious blood of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>He that loseth his soule, he loseth God, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Angels, Saints, and he loseth Heaven and Glory for ever. He that is thus lost is lost <hi>intolerably,</hi> lost <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably,</hi> lost <hi>irrecoverably.</hi> Therefore before you mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage your soules to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, you were desired to sit
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:120712:45"/>down and consider what your soules are worth, and then, if you can; bestow them upon the devil; and if you can be so vile as to part with such precious soules for a base lust,</p>
            <p>The eleventh discovered to you your dreadful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.9. <hi>Surely they are drunk, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.</hi> He tells you,</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That you are under a sore spiritual blast of divine vengeance.</hi> That the greatest &amp; worst of all plagues are <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, inward, soul-plagues.</hi> Men may wallow in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward delights and comforts, and thinkall is well, because they do not hear from God
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:120712:45"/>in thundering and lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while in the mean time wrath is upon their heads, their soules, their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and themselves at the next door to <hi>final reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> O fear and tremble.</p>
            <p>The twelfth layes you in, as it were, a <hi>motive</hi> from your <hi>future condition,</hi> that it might waken you to a serious consideration of <hi>your present estate,</hi> from <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24. <hi>And E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch walked with God, and he was not; for God took him, &amp;c.</hi> and raised this truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That <hi>there is a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture estate for man.</hi> And therfore exhorts you; First, to live as those that expect a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture estate. Secondly, to <hi>meditate</hi> much upon that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture estate. And thirdly, to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:120712:46"/>
               <hi>prepare</hi> for it, that when you go hence, and be no more seen, you may be with God as <hi>Enoch</hi> was.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth comes, and taking his text from <hi>Hosea</hi> 5.15. <hi>In their affliction they will seek me early, leaves this precious truth among you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>That times of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are times of Prayer and Supplication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore counselled you, that the <hi>seasonablenesse</hi> of the work might cause you to close with it. The times are <hi>times of affliction;</hi> Oh that every one of you would make them <hi>times of prayer and supplication. In their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they will seek me early;</hi> afflictions upon the <hi>Nation,</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:120712:46"/>afflictions upon your <hi>selves:</hi> O be not weary of this duty of prayet and supplication.
<note place="margin">It was the day of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Morning-Exercise.</hi>
               </note> To morrow is a praying day: O come as the sons and daughters of God, to <hi>wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> with God, and with the Israelites, <hi>to draw water, and poure it out before the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourteenth, he layes in a <hi>motive</hi> (as it were) to this duty, fetched from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his eares are open unto their prayers; but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.</hi> As <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Joshua</hi> said, behold, he might say, I have set life and death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; rest not in a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition; <hi>the frownes of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:120712:47"/>a King are as the Messengers of death;</hi> surely the frowns of God areas the Harbingers of hell.</p>
            <p>The fifteenth doth, as it were make use of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and from <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.2. <hi>Ye shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy;</hi> gives you this note:</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>That holinesse is Gods perfection.</hi> Holinesse is that perfection whereby God doth act suitably to his nature, and agreeably to his will.</p>
            <p>God is the <hi>Pattern</hi> of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, he is the <hi>Rule</hi> of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, he is the <hi>highest cause</hi> of holinesse. The holinesse of the creature doth consist in an universal hatred of sin, a delight in the things that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:120712:47"/>are holy, and in a conformity to Gods Will. He told you, hence it was the best po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to be holy, because thereby you shall be sure to be of the strongest side, to be of Gods side. What will become of all unholy ones in the day of Christ? surely, God will not know them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have not his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage upon them; <hi>You shall be holy, for I am holy. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holinesse no man shall see the Lord.</hi> If you would have God like you, you must be like God, be holy as he is holy, study holinesse.</p>
            <p>The sixteenth he tells you, as if it had been a studied context, <hi>That hearing of God will not serve to make you holy, unlesse you see him.</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:120712:48"/>The sight of God in Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discoveries, is that which will make you <hi>admire God,</hi> and <hi>abhor your selves,</hi> from <hi>Job</hi> 42.5. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the eare, but now mine eye seeth thee: Wherefore I abhorre my self, and repent in dust and ashes;</hi> Rest not in a <hi>general report</hi> of God, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for an experimental knowledge and discovery of him; Pray that you may <hi>see him in his glory,</hi> while you <hi>hear of him in his Word;</hi> that so you may be able also to say, I have heard of thee often by the hearing of the eare. but now mine eye seeth thee: Wherefore I abhor my selfe, and repent in dust and ashes.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:120712:48"/>
            <p> The seventeenth, Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or Prophet of the Lord, he cries from the words of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.18. <hi>Take heed how you heare.</hi> Take heed <hi>before</hi> hearing, take heed <hi>in</hi> hearing, take heed <hi>after</hi> hearing. Take heed <hi>before</hi> hearing to <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> take heed <hi>in</hi> hearing to <hi>attention,</hi> take heed <hi>after</hi> hearing to <hi>practice,</hi> to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; <hi>Be you doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own soules.</hi> Take heed <hi>what</hi> you heare, and take heed <hi>how</hi> you hear. Take heed what you heare, lest the <hi>Preacher</hi> deceive you; and take heed how you heare, lest <hi>you</hi> deceive your <hi>selves.</hi>

            <p>The eighteenth took his text from <hi>Acts</hi> 10.36.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:120712:49"/>
               <hi>Preaching peace by Jesus Christ:</hi> and gives you these observations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Ministery of the Gospel is a Ministery of peace,</hi> preaching peace, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the peace which the Gospel preacheth, is by Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis of Christ in a foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold respect. 1. 'Tis of Christs <hi>purchase.</hi> 2. Of Christs <hi>applying.</hi> 3. Of Christs <hi>continuing.</hi> 4. Of Christs <hi>publishing.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, 1. Certainly all <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse</hi> men, are <hi>peacelesse</hi> men; they that are without <hi>Christ</hi> are without <hi>peace;</hi> that's dreadful. Secondly, it was to encourage poor sinners to come to God thorow Christ; they are <hi>wrath,</hi> but he is <hi>peace;</hi> and therefare concludes in the third place,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:120712:49"/>that they, and they only, and all they are happy that accept of Christ upon Gods termes, because that Christ is their peace, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Being justified by faith, we have peace with God,</hi> Rom. 5.</p>
            <p>The nineteenth comes as it were with a Use of Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation upon the former text; doth Christ preach peace? then <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.1. <hi>Comfort ye, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ye, my people, saith your God, speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, tell her that her sin is pardoned, &amp;c.</hi> and gives you this comfortable doctrine from thence:</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>That pardon of sin is the ground of all solid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:120712:50"/>
            <p> So, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.2. <hi>Son, be of good comfort, thy sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee.</hi> Pardon of sin, O its a comfortable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis a rich mercy, it cost Christ his blood; 'tis a <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing</hi> mercy. And remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it was told you in the Use of Examination, that <hi>pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace</hi> alwayes goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with <hi>healing grace:</hi> whereever sin is <hi>pardoned, corruption</hi> is <hi>mortified;</hi> and therefore let no man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume of an interest in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that lives in sin; <hi>Whom Christ justifieth, he doth also sanctisie,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.</p>
            <p>The twentieth Messenger from God, taught you <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Providence,</hi> from <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.5. <hi>He that gathereth in Summer is a wise son; but he
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:120712:50"/>that sleepeth in harvest, is a son that causeth shame:</hi> from thence he gave you this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>That it is a special part of mans wisdome, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the seasons of spiritua plenty.</hi> Now you have the seasons of plenty.</p>
            <p>What are they? the season of <hi>life,</hi> and the season of <hi>health,</hi> the season of <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,</hi> and the season of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</hi> And therefore that which he did earnestly call for, was; First, to bewaile your former folly, that you have made no better use of spiritual seasons of plenty. Secondly, to beg wisdom of God. And thirdly, be sure, now to make this your wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that in these seasons of plenty, you would lay up
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:120712:51"/>good food, and not sticks, strawes, pebbles and dirt: but</p>
            <p n="1">1. Lay in Scripture-<hi>truthes</hi> against times of <hi>error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Lay in Scripture-<hi>dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> against times of <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>

            <p>The one and twentieth he told you that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis possible for people that live under the Ordinances of God, to bring forth nothing but briars and thornes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the end of these that bring forth nothing but briars and thornes, is to be hurned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both these dreadful truths
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:120712:51"/>he gave you from <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.8. How nearly are Christians concerned to look to their fruit, and to bring forth good fruit? what's good fruit?</p>
            <p>That is good fruit,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That's answerable to your <hi>standing</hi> in the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard: O let not a plant (it may be, of half a years stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, shame you that are of twenty, thirty, fourty years standing in the Gospel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Bring forth fruit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the cost and paines God hath been at with you. Let not that ground think to escape with the same fruit, upon whom God bestows much cost and much paines, as that which hath had none of these precious influences.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Bring forth fruit suitable
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:120712:52"/>to your <hi>former barrennesse,</hi> Rom. 6.19. <hi>As ye have yielded your members servants to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse, and to iniquity, unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, to holinesse.</hi> Give God the same measure you have given the <hi>devil,</hi> give God the same measure you have given the <hi>flesh,</hi> give God the same measure you have given the <hi>world;</hi> O be as fruitful for God as ever you have been for the devil. If you mean to bring forth briars and thornes, that is, (in English) if you mean to be drunkards, unclean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Sabbath-breakers, swearers, reproachers of God and his Ordinances, &amp;c. still, and to live as you list; if you will still bring forth briars
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:120712:52"/>and thornes, quit your sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all ye profane wretches, get you into the wildernesse, that's the place forbriars &amp; thorns. Wo be to them that are planted in the garden of God, and yet bring forth briars and thornes: <hi>better</hi> you you were borne in the <hi>desert,</hi> then in the <hi>garden of God;</hi> of all places Christ will not endure a thorn there; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his counsel was,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If ever you would be fruitful, get into Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Lay your hearts open to the influences of heaven, <hi>(A very smart and spiritual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression)</hi> that is, open your hearts to the Word, and to the motions of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Take heed of wicked company, and take heed of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:120712:53"/>secret lusts; secret lusts will choak the Word, and you will become unfruitful.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Pray that God would make you fruitful, that <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your fruit unto holinesse, you may have your end in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two and twentieth, from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18 31. <hi>Make you a new heart and a new spirit, for why will you die, O house of Israel?</hi> insisted excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon these foure points.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The necessity of a new heart, there's no life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; <hi>Make you a new heart,</hi> for why will you <hi>die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Our impotency, our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to make our selves a new heart; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the</p>
            <p n="3">3. Place, he shewed the equity of God, requiring it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:120712:53"/>at our hand; for though you have lost your power to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, yet God hath not lost his power and authority to command; 'tis equal with God to require you should make your selves new hearts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is, though ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, yet it is just with God to condemn you for not having new hearts, though it be not in your power to make you new hearts; because once he gave us power, and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately sinned it away, &amp;c. Therefore he discovered isom hence,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The danger of resting in <hi>moral honesty;</hi> he gave encouragement enough to men to be civil and morally honest; but he faithfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his office in caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng you to take heed of rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:120712:54"/>in moral honesty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He warned you from resting in <hi>formality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. From taking up with <hi>outward reformation,</hi> from grosse sins only: are there not many that think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Saints, berause they are no drunkards and swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and yet have not one spark of grace?</p>
            <p n="4">4. He cautioned you to take heed of resting in a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Profession at large,</hi> namely, as you are Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Protestants, &amp;c. all these were good he told you, but all these fall short of a new heart; they are not the thing that God calls for; therefore he pressed you to the getting of a new heart, 1. By deep conviction. 2. By waiting upon the Word of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:120712:54"/>God. 3. By constant suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that promise, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>I will take away the heart of stone, and a new heart will I give unto you.</hi> Blessed be God, that which is in the <hi>command impossible</hi> on your side, God hath undertaken it by <hi>promise:</hi> make you a new heart; O, saith the convinced soule, Lord, I cannot; then saith God, <hi>I will take away the heart of stone, and give an heart of flesh.</hi> If the command finds work, the promise findes strength; if the command dishearten you, let the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise encourage you; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is he that hath promised, who also will do it. <hi>I will give you a new heart:</hi> go, and presse God with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:120712:55"/>
            <p> The three and twentieth preached upon the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus, Luke</hi> 16. <hi>last, I pray thee, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Abraham, <hi>send</hi> Lazarus <hi>to warne my brethren &amp;c. No,</hi> saith <hi>Abraham, they have Moses and the Prophets, let them heare them, for if they hear not them; they will not be perswaded, though one rose from the dead;</hi> He shewed you most excellently what a vain and foolish thing it is to fancy some other way for conversion, and for turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men to God, then that which God himselfe hath already established; <hi>No,</hi> saith God, <hi>If they will not believe</hi> Moses <hi>and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, they will not hear, though one rise from the dead;</hi> and he gave clear evidences of it;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:120712:55"/>truly the first might serve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of all, it was this: no way that can be thought of will do men good for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and conversion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse God set in with it, (mark the foundation upon which he builds his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) now is it likely and probable God should set in with wayes of mens inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when they despise the wayes of his own ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Suppose one should come from hell all in flames, and tell you what the damned suffer there: is it probable this should do you good, when God tells you the same thing in the Word, and you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him? Its a most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing argument, men that despise Ministers, and Word,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:120712:56"/>and Sacraments, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of God, will never believe a report of a doubtful authority; <hi>You have a more sure word of prophecie,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto you do well that you take heed, &amp;c.</hi> despise it not, lest you provoke God to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the means you have; and then wo unto you that ever you were borne.</p>
            <p>The next preached to you concerning <hi>heart-purity,</hi> from <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart. &amp;c.</hi> He shewed you the nature of heart-purity. It keepes the soule unspotted from the world.</p>
            <p>He shewed the frame of it towards sin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis burdened under sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It resolves aguinst all sin.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:120712:56"/> 3. It makes out for power against sin, as well as for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; thats an infallible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A pure heart is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally renewing repentance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A pure heart is full of self-abhorrency.</p>
            <p>The blessednesse of it he shewed from this, that such they shall see God: and this is enough; for certainly the vision of God is the very heaven of heaven; take this away, and heaven would be heaven no longer: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the pure in heart are blessed: you were directed to the pursuit of this purity of heart, by six <hi>take heeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Take heed of selfopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for that will destroy you.</p>

            <p> And now consider, God hath sent (as I said before) his Prophets, his servants; <hi>all</hi> of them in great numbers, rising up early and sending them, time after time, and morning after morning; yea, take notice of the verse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my text, God in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Prophets, <hi>he doth speak himself to you;</hi> 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding observable in the fourteenth verse; <hi>I have spoken to you, rising early, and speaking, &amp;c.</hi> God in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his servants the Prophets to you, he speaks to you him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, thats much to be laid to heart, that God in all his servants the Prophets, morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after morning, for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty six mornings together, I say, that God hath spoken to you himself; <hi>He that

Thus <hi>gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> hath God fulfilled the former part of the text, in <hi>sending all his servants the Prophets, rising up early and sending them, calling you to reforme upon no worse termes, then your present comfort, and your future glory;</hi> Now if you shall ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:120712:62"/>fulfil the second part of the text; <hi>But ye have nor inclined your eare, nor hearkened to me;</hi> O what will become of you, if there be found those (and it may be they are not here, to whom this Word most properly belongs) I say, if there be found those that have not so much as <hi>lent God an eare,</hi> given him the <hi>hearing;</hi> God hath <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen early</hi> in his Prophets, but they have been <hi>sleeping in their beds,</hi> in their bed of <hi>nature,</hi> and in their bed of <hi>security;</hi> God hath sent his Prophet, and they have thought scorne to <hi>set</hi> their <hi>foot</hi> over the <hi>threshold;</hi> God hath opened his <hi>mouth,</hi> but they would not open their <hi>eare:</hi> What will you do in
